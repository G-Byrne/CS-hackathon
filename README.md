# CS-hackathon

// use the tabs google tabs api to store tab creation timestamp for each tab.id that is open on the window
  // creating an event listener for a new tab opened
  // get access to the tab details of the tab opened and store those details

// event listener for tabs closing
  // remove the closed tab's data from the storage

// potentially on a time schedule
  // iterate through each object in the google storage
  // calculate time elapsed since open
  // set tab color to a particular shade based on age

// change the color of the tab based on the age of the tab

// we want to send google notifications for tab birthdays
